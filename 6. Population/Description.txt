In demographics, the world population is the total number of humans currently living, and was estimated to have reached 7.8 billion people as of March 2020.
It took over 200,000 years of human history for the world's population to reach 1 billion, and only 200 years more to reach 7 billion.

The world population has experienced continuous growth following the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the end of the Black Death in 1350, when it was near 370 million.
The highest global population growth rates, with increases of over 1.8% per year, occurred between 1955 and 1975—peaking to 2.1% between 1965 and 1970.
The growth rate declined to 1.2% between 2010 and 2015 and is projected to decline further in the course of the 21st century.
However, the global population is still increasing and is projected to reach about 10 billion in 2050 and more than 11 billion in 2100.
